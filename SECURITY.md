# Security Policy

This document details the security policy followed in Ironclad.

## Supported Versions

Ironclad right now is pre 1.X.X, making support of stable releases not a
priority. The code just changes too much to be able to make any guarantees of
the sort.

Once Ironclad enters 1.X, this section will contain a list of the currently
supported versions, support deadlines, and the like.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security vulnerabilities, we strongly recommend avoiding the usual
issue reporting channels, and instead either:

- Send an email to the project directly, you can send those email to
[this address](mailto:streaksu@ironclad-os.org).

- Send an email to one (or several) of the members of the developent team, the
lineup of which can be found [here](https://ironclad-os.org/orgstructure.html).

### Follow-up and vulnerability disclosure

Once a vulnerability is submitted and confirmed, we will fix it at earnest and
disclose it when fixed and released in an official release. We will eagerly
make releases for this, as to get fixes quickly to the user.
