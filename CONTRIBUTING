Thanks for considering contributing to Ironclad, this document details
practices, coding standards, and other useful information for your life to be
easier.

-- Useful flags for debugging and diagnostics --

When building ironclad, debug-friendly flags are the default, but for special
purposes the flags can be overwritten by setting the ADAFLAGS variable as such:

```bash
gprbuild -p ironclad.gpr -XADAFLAGS="blablabla"
```

The same can be done with CFLAGS or LDFLAGS. For ADAFLAGS, the recommended
flags are "-Og -Wall -gnaty -g" for debug purposes.

-- Documenting code --

Each code contribution is expected to add the relevant documentation as
comments and standalone documentation in the case of syscalls or kernel
interfaces.

-- Licensing code --

You may only contribute code that complies with the project's license, or code
ruled by GPL-compatible licenses under certain conditions, its the
responsability of the contributor to ensure this is the case.

When adding new code, be sure to check the changes have a valid license header,
and detail the authors of the code. For files with a main author and small
touches being done on top of it, you can update the authors in the copyright
to `Copyright (C) 2022 [main author's name], et. al.`, or add your name or
pseudonym for a major contribution to the comma-separated list.

--  Publishing the changes --

You can just open a task in the Ironclad savannah page, which is
(https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/ironclad), and upload a patch containing
the changes, which will be reviewed and eventually merged manually.
