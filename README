Ironclad is a kernel for x86_64 devices exclusively (for now), written in Ada.

-- Building --

If the project's configure has not been generated, there is a autogen.sh for
that purpose. The steps for a generated project using gprbuild are:

./configure                  # Configure.
gprbuild -r ironclad.gpr -j4 # Build the kernel.
./install.sh                 # Install.

To run the formal proofing framework, which is not necessary, one can run:

gnatprove -P ironclad.gpr -U --prover=cvc4,altergo,z3

Several flags and variables are available for tuning:

- ADAFLAGS, ASMFLAGS, and LDFLAGS, passed as environment variables to gprbuild.
- DESTDIR and PREFIX for ./install.sh.
- Pass 'strip' as the only argument to ./install.sh for stripped binaries.

A list of the tools needed for compilation and checked by configure is:

- gprbuild and a compatible Ada and C compilers.
- gnatprove for formal proofing if desired.
- GNU Info for building the documentation with Info and PDF support.

A good set of flags for a release build is:

ADAFLAGS='-flto -O2' CFLAGS='-flto -O2' LDFLAGS='-flto -O2'

-- Documentation --

The project features info and PDF files generated from the texinfo source in
the docs subdirectory, and they are generated and installed automatically when
running ./install.sh.

The generated documentation features information about a lot of kernel-specific
concepts along with syscall listings and project information. Apart of that,
there is this README and a CONTRIBUTING.md with contributing guidelines in the
root directory of the project.
