Ironclad is a kernel for x86_64 devices exclusively (for now), written in Ada.

-- Building --

If the project's configure has not been generated, there is a autogen.sh.
The steps for a generated project are the usual:

./configure
make
make test # If wanted.
make install-strip

Several flags and variables are available for tuning, ./configure --help will
display and explain them.

A list of the tools needed for compilation and checked by configure is:

- autoconf 2.69 and automake.
- An Ada compiler, preferably gcc.
- A standard linker and GAS assembler.
- xorriso and QEMU for testing.

A good set of flags for a release build is:

make ADAFLAGS='-flto -gnaty -Wall -O2 -g' LDFLAGS='-flto -O2' LD=gcc

-- Documentation --

Under the docs directory one can find a hefty ammount of documentation
describing a number of OS-specific concepts. Note this documentation does
not explain code or excuse the lack of comments in the code, but aims to shed
light on higher-level design decisions and interface between userland and
kernel, that are assumed in the implementation. Some useful links are:

- Kernel command line and values available (docs/cmdlineargs.md).
- Syscall mechanism and list (docs/syscalls.md).
- VFS structure, roots, and object interaction (docs/vfs.md).
- Contributing to the project (docs/contributing.md).
