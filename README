Ironclad is a kernel for x86_64 devices exclusively (for now), written in Ada.

-- Building --

If the project's configure has not been generated, there is a autogen.sh.
The steps for a generated project are the usual:

./configure
make
make test # If wanted.
make install-strip

Several flags and variables are available for tuning, ./configure --help will
display and explain them.

A list of the tools needed for compilation and checked by configure is:

- autoconf 2.69 and automake.
- An Ada compiler, preferably gcc.
- A standard linker and GAS assembler.
- GNU Info for building the documentation.
- xorriso and QEMU for testing.

A good set of flags for a release build is:

make ADAFLAGS='-flto -gnaty -Wall -O2 -g' LDFLAGS='-flto -O2' LD=gcc

-- Documentation --

The makefile of the project features targets for generating info and PDF files
from the texinfo in the docs subdirectory, the targets are:

make info
make pdf
make install-info
make install-pdf

The generated documentation features information about a lot of kernel-specific
concepts along with syscall listings and project information. Apart of that,
there is this README and a CONTRIBUTING.md with contributing guidelines in the
root directory of the project.
